A repository storing all relevant code and snippets for my participation during a Quantum Machine Learning REU at SenSIP Labs @ ASU, Summer 2024, under the direction of Dr. Suren Jayasuriya. 

Big thanks to my mentors Greg Vetaw, Suren Jayasuriya, Glen Uehara, and Andreas Spanias. 

Formalized project code can be found under the same profile /sparsequanv.
