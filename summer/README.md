# Summer Review of Quantum Machine Learning
## Introduction
Welcome to summer review in quantum machine learning. We embark on a brief journey into understanding how to program Quantum Computers and Quantum Simulators. In this introductory session, we delve into the foundational aspects of quantum algorithms and introduce you to an implementation of a basic quantum machine learning algorithm.

Our exploration begins with the fundamental principles underlying the development of quantum algorithms. We begin by introduction to quantum bits, quantum gates and quantum circuits. We learn how this can be applied to classical probelms using quantum logic. Finally we learn some of the intricacies of quantum machine learning. In this paradigm, we shall observe how quantum circuits interface with classical machine learning frameworks, thereby facilitating a deeper comprehension of this hybrid approach.

Of particular interest is the concept of adaptive quantum algorithms (parameterized quantum circuits). The manipulation and refinement of circuit parameters occur within the classical domain, but we adapt them to run in the quantum domain. Through the application of classical optimization techniques and loss functions, we harness the potential of quantum states while ensuring computational efficacy.

Finally, we shed light upon quantum simulations, also known as Hamiltonian simulations, time permitting. This indispensable algorithmic tool orchestrates the time evolution of quantum systems, culminating in the attainment of a stable state. Through the application of this technique, we equip ourselves with the means to analyze quantum circuits and extract pertinent insights.

As a foundational stepping stone into the captivating world of quantum programming and simulation, we hope you take some knowledge of this an apply it to your research. 

Let us embark upon this intellectual odyssey with fervor and curiosity, as we unravel the mysteries of the quantum world.
